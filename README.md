## Data Science Project Template
This `template_setup.py` code creates a folder tree in the project's root directory. The folder tree can be fully expressed or it can be minimal by changing the argument of the `create_project()` function.

To use in your projects, simply download the `template_setup.py` file and run it in a new project directory. It will populate the folders and create README.md files for each folder. Each README.md provides an overview of the folder's purpose.
